# Electronic-Gadget-Inventory-Management-System-using-C-programming

This project has been developed using the C programming language, with the primary goal of gaining practical insights into the application of data structures and sorting algorithms. It specifically utilizes a Singly-Linked Linked List and the Quicksort Algorithm.

The electronic gadget inventory is presented in a tabular format with five columns: Name, Brand, Model, Price, and Quantity. 

The project features a menu with five distinct choices:

1. **Display Inventory:** This option allows users to print the entire gadget inventory. The inventory itself has been constructed using a Singly-Linked Linked List.

2. **Add Gadget:** Users can utilize this option to seamlessly incorporate new electronic gadgets into the pre-existing inventory.

3. **Search for Gadget:** This functionality enables users to search for a specific gadget based on parameters such as name, brand, model, or quantity. The search process has been implemented using a straightforward linear search algorithm.

4. **Update Gadget Information:** Users have the ability to update the price and quantity information of the gadgets, ensuring that the inventory remains accurate and up-to-date.

5. **Sort and Display Inventory:** This option facilitates the sorting of the inventory in ascending order based on various parameters, including name, brand, model, price, and quantity.
